# Contributors

This Markdown file is intended to thank Heleris FW contributors.

Each type of contribution goes to a different part of this file, only by organization, being:

- **Code**: contributors who contributed directly to the code, whether source code (.c) or header (.h).
- **Grammar**: contributors who contributed to grammar errors, name improvements and other things related to code or wiki identifiers.
- **Wiki**: contributors who contributed to the wiki, either by creating a page (and providing basic content), correcting or adding information, or removing outdated information.
