# Heleris FW

Heleris FW is a high-performance framework developed in C and designed to facilitate the creation of programs and games using OpenGL. With planned support for C++ and compatibility with other languages ​​through bridges such as CPython and Java, Heleris FW offers an efficient and powerful solution for developers seeking direct control over their graphics projects.

## Main Features:
- **Superior Performance**: Developed in C, Heleris FW provides exceptional speed ideal for intensive graphics applications.
- **HTML-Based GUI System**: Facilitates the creation of graphical interfaces with intuitive organization using HTML-based elements.

- **Input Abstraction**: Flexible support for user input, adaptable to different platforms such as Linux.
- **Custom Types**: Includes custom data types for better readability and practical use.

## Future of the Framework:
Heleris FW is an open source project intended to evolve as a solid foundation for creating a Unity/Godot style game engine in C and C++, allowing programmers to choose between the framework and engine for their project. Its modular and flexible architecture is poised to grow with the needs of the game development community.
