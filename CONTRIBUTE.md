## How to contribute?

Contributing to this project is not difficult, and we would greatly appreciate anyone who could contribute, even if it's just a small improvement.

Some steps are straightforward:

- **Read [coding_style.md](https://github.com/0GuguH9/HelerisFW/blob/master/coding_style.md)**: Despite being somewhat lengthy, you don't need to read everything. Most of it consists of explanations and examples. The key aspects to focus on are function prefixes linked to structures, naming conventions, and the system for creating structures like `struct` and `enum`. The coding style allows for personal preferences primarily in code creation but not as much in function and structure declarations.
  
- **Fork the repository**: This is the most crucial step in contributing as it allows you to proceed to the next stage.
  
- **Submit a pull request**: Make your contribution by submitting a pull request to the framework.

And that's it! Your contributions will be reviewed and integrated!

If you're interested in seeing the framework's future plans, refer to the [`future_rote.md`](https://github.com/0GuguH9/HelerisFW/blob/master/future_rote.md) file. It outlines the framework's intended roadmap, and you can contribute by adding details, suggesting modifications or improvements, and more.
