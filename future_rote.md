# Future Route

This Markdown file outlines the future plans for the Heleris FW framework.

## Content Loading

The resource loading system is crucial for handling textures, sounds, models, and other assets efficiently.

- **HRSContentLoader**: Manages general resource loading information.
- **HRSTexture**: Represents a 2D texture.
- **HRSSound**: Represents a sound.

## Graphics

The graphics system is planned as follows:

- **HRSRender**: Provides quick initialization of graphics settings, offering flexibility as a utility.
- **HRSShaderProgram**: Facilitates the rapid creation of shader programs.
- **HRSShader**: Supports the rapid creation of individual shaders.
- **HRSRenderBatch**: Implements a content design system that allows a bit of flexibility with a easy-to-use way to draw.

This framework aims to balance speed and flexibility in graphical operations, offering robust tools for application development.
