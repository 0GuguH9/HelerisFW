# Future Route

This Markdown file outlines the future plans for the Heleris FW framework.

## Content Loading

The resource loading system is crucial for handling textures, sounds, models, and other assets efficiently.

- **HRSContextManager**: Manages general resource loading information.
- **HRSTexture**: Represents a 2D texture.
- **HRSSound**: Represents a sound.

## Graphics

The graphics system is planned as follows:

- **HRSRender**: Provides quick initialization of graphics settings, offering flexibility as a utility.
- **HRSShaderProgram**: Facilitates the rapid creation of shader programs.
- **HRSShader**: Supports the rapid creation of individual shaders.
- **HRSDrawBatch**: Implements a content design system that allows customization of vertex and fragment shaders within a standardized framework. It provides a fast method to use graphics in the framework while maintaining some level of flexibility.

This framework aims to balance speed and flexibility in graphical operations, offering robust tools for application development.
